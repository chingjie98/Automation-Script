I built this VBA automation script during my Summer Internship. 

I had alot of fun and this is probably one of my more meaningful projects I've undertaken!

Albeit this is a pseudo script, the original code allows the user to be able to enter into JIRA platform automatically.
Once entered, the script will also automatically go to the user's defined field to download a csv file, and format the csv file before pasting into an excel spreadsheet.
The formatting of the csv file will be detailed the way the user wants before the start of the csv file.

The whole process is extremely seamless, and this helps to save my company 45 - 50 minutes daily.

The original process:
One of every team's member will go to JIRA, find whichever files they want to download. Then format the csv file manually, then copy paste into an excel spreadsheet that will then be used as a dashboard.
This is extremely slow and prone to human error.

With my script:
Member will just have to fill up the pre-defined field ONCE, and can forever run the script however many times they want. They can leave their computer to do other things during the process which helps to save time and reduce human error as well.
